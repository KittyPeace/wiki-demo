Dear Dr. Hao Geng,  
Following our recent e-mail and telephone communications, I am pleased to let you know that I can offer you a Visiting Scholar position at the Konstanz University. This is a one-year post. You told me the better time you join my research group is from September 2022 to August 2023. I hope you could come here sooner. As we have discussed, your research will be in the area of quantum transport in mesoscopic devices and exotic material properties in quantum engineered systems. I am certain you will gain new knowledge and skills in our laboratory, and I am equally optimistic that your participation will bring about new opportunities for collaboration between us. We will provide you with all the equipment and facilities necessary for your research. Should you require any further information, please feel free to contact me.
I look forward to your joining.
Best regards,
